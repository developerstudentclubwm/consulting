## CAMPUS ESCORT APP W&M PRIVACY POLICY

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit the “MindVersity” app.

### PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT

When you visit the App and login, we automatically collect certain information about your device, known as your API key. This is used to determine whether you have previously created a profile and to identify your profile on the app if you are a Driver. Additionally, if you are a Driver, we collect your name so we can share it with the Rider.

Riders who choose to use the app share their name and phone number so Drivers can contact them if there is a problem during the ride.

This device uses no tracking technology.

This app does not require nor offer any purchases, and thus does not store any information pertaining to such.

When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device Information and Profile Information.

### HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

We use the Profile Information that we collect to help Riders find a Driver. Drivers can call Riders if there is an issue with the ride.

We use the Device Information that we collect to connect a verified Driver’s William & Mary account with the Driver-side of the app. Drivers can accept and reject ride requests from Riders.

### SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

Only elected executive members of APO will be able to ever view the Rider and Driver information in a Google spreadsheet.

Finally, we may also share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.

### DATA RETENTION

A Google Cloud function runs every day to clear all information out of the Firebase Database. A record of rides will be kept in a Google spreadsheet and deleted every 6 months.

### INTENDED USERS

The Campus Escort App is intended for students and faculty at the College of William & Mary.

### CHANGES

We may update this privacy policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.
